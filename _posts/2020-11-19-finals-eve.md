title: "Day Before Final"
---

Not sure what to think right now. I feel pretty lowkey today. This is my first blog post, exciting stuff. I guess I can just write all my feelings out on here. I have a CS Final tomorrow, not too stressed, seems pretty straightforward. My girlfriend is having a crisis on what major she should choose or whether she should transfer back to our state school. I'm kind of having a little crisis too as I'm not sure what major/majors I want to pursue. I think I'm just gonna try to take as many quantitative classes here and go with the flow. We'll see what majors I end up with. Well, to my future self, I hope you end up successful, I hope you're happy, I hope you won't feel as lonely as you feel right now.
